# QMUL_simpleJamendoRepo

## What is?

This is a simple script to download a list of songs from Jamendo and semantically map them into a SEPA instance. 
It is so ugly and simple that you probably won't need it! It is just an utility that I use to have a set of jamendo tracks accessible via SEPA for my demos.
